An inter-office messaging app.

Don't use any of this code.  It's terrible.  I keep it around for a laugh, and as a reminder of what not to do.

OMG.  OMG.  Have you every looked back at your old code and thought, "I can't believe I wrote that!"  I wouldn't recommend anybody write a program like the way I did this.  Sure, the code worked in production, but it's so embarrassing.  My earlier lack of understanding about certain concepts is painfully obvious. The code is terrible.  The architecture is terrible.  In fact, the app itself was annoying to the users.

If I were ever to rewrite this app, I can see a gazillion things I would do differently.
